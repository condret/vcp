		  so you don't have to start the whole thing again just because
		  one single file didn't ant to cooperate. prints a list of failed
		  files after finishing its list. so after fixing the problem
		  (encoding/whatever) you just start again with "-k" and you're done


LIMITS:
		- only regular files and directories, no symlinks, nodes or sth.
		- max. ??? files, max. filesize ??? Bytes, max. list size ??? Bytes
