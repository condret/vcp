These are short notes for me, not intended to be clear for everyone.
I will clean up all this when the project reaches a stable state.


 * -l switch that prints limits (filenum, sizes, etc.)
 * fix that goddam hell of var-types (llong, ulong, double, etc.)
 * progress output: respect terminal width
 * signal handling (delete incomplete on interrupt)
 * error messages: reduce, rewrite texts
 * overflow protection for large vars (size, etc.)
 * free space check?
 * directory attributes: ignored?
 * code BEAUTIFYing (should go along anyway)
 * last but probably most important: DOCUMENTATION! (readme, proper
   homepage, github-wiki, etc.)
