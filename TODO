These are short notes for me, not intended to be clear for everyone.
I will clean up all this when the project reaches a stable state.

 * symlinks
 * signal handling (delete incomplete on interrupt)
 * free space check?
 * last but probably most important: DOCUMENTATION! (readme, proper
   homepage, github-wiki, etc.)


Known bugs:

	* transfer fails on i686 box with limited ressources for an 4.2GiB
	  mdf file:  "unable to open for reading (Value too large for
				  defined data type)"

	* transfer of 5.2GiB multiple large files fails on i686 box with
	  limited ressources:
	  "vcp: malloc.c:3074: sYSMALLOc: Assertion `(old_top == (((mbinptr)
	   (((char *) &((av)->bins[((1) - 1) * 2])) - __builtin_offsetof
	   (struct malloc_chunk, fd)))) && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned
	   long) (old_size) >= (unsigned long)((((__builtin_offsetof (struct
	    malloc_chunk, fd_nextsize))+((2 * (sizeof(size_t))) - 1)) &
		~((2 * (sizeof(size_t))) - 1))) && ((old_top)->size & 0x1) &&
		((unsigned long)old_end & pagemask) == 0)' failed."
