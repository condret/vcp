These are short notes for me, not intended to be clear for everyone.
I will clean up all this when the project reaches a stable state.

 * fix transfer of large files on i686 ("value too large for specified type")
 * fix progress output left on successful termination
 * fix directory deletion in case of -d
 * clean up copy_file()
 * attach reasons for fails to failed-file-list
 * fix that goddam hell of var-types (llong, ulong, double, etc.)
 * add compile stamp to usage information
 * signal handling (delete incomplete on interrupt)
 * error messages: reduce, rewrite texts
 * overflow protection for large vars (size, etc.)
 * free space check?
 * directory attributes: ignored?
 * code BEAUTIFYing (should go along anyway)
 * last but probably most important: DOCUMENTATION! (readme, proper
   homepage, github-wiki, etc.)


Known bugs:

	* on a i686 machine with only some mb left of free memory:
	
		vcp: malloc.c:3074: sYSMALLOc: Assertion `(old_top == (((mbinptr)
		(((char *) &((av)->bins[((1) - 1) * 2])) - __builtin_offsetof
		(struct malloc_chunk, fd)))) && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned long)
		(old_size) >= (unsigned long)((((__builtin_offsetof(struct
		malloc_chunk, fd_nextsize))+((2 * (sizeof(size_t))) - 1)) & 
		~((2 * (sizeof(size_t))) - 1))) && ((old_top)->size & 0x1) && 
		((unsigned long)old_end & pagemask) == 0)' failed.
