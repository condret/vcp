These are short notes for me, not intended to be clear for everyone.
I will clean up all this when the project reaches a stable state.

 * symlinks
 * speed calculation per file?
 * signal handling (delete incomplete on interrupt)
 * multithreading: worker-thread for copying, controller-thread that
   sends periodic interrupts and generates progress output
 * free space check?
 * last but probably most important: DOCUMENTATION! (readme, proper
   homepage, github-wiki, etc.)
