These are short notes for me, not intended to be clear for everyone.
I will clean up all this when the project reaches a stable state.


TODO:	- -l switch that prints limits (filenum, sizes,...)
		- fix that goddam hell of var-types (llong, ulong, double,...)
		- progress: filesize, re-sort
		- new progress format (like rsync):
		  	/path/some/where/file.ext
		  	File: [.......]		Total: [.......]
		- code BEAUTIFYing (should go along anyway)
		- signal handling (delete incomplete on interrupt)
		- rewrite error messages (filenames, shortening)
		- overflow protection for large vars (size, etc.)
		- free space check?
		- directory attributes: dropped?
		- last: feature-list :-)
